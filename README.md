  Are you well-versed at comparing famous people and their "success" in terms of Instagram followers? Well, could it be, you got quite good a sense of popularity, or you have been spending too much time liking celebrities' posts on instagram. ðŸ¤¨
</p>

<p>
The game is quite simple. To begin with, you are given a brief description for both celebrity accounts being compared. The game is about guessing who has more followers on Instagram. The game is presented in two modalities to choose out of: 
  
  - #1 modality: if you manage to guess right while comparing all accounts - which are randomly picked - without losing, you win.
  - #2 modality: it is the most common one. You keep guessing who has more followers, between the two accounts being compared, and keep track of your score until your guess is wrong, at which point it's game over.

<p>
  Instagram Higher Lower App is written in Python and you can launch it either from any local IDE which is able to compile Python source code, or any other Python code editors/compilers from the web which enables you to edit and run the code.
