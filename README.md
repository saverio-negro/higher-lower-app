  Are you well-versed at comparing famous people and their "success" in terms of Instagram followers? Well, could it be, you got quite good a sense of popularity, or you have been spending too much time liking posts on instagram. ðŸ¤¨
</p>

<p>
  The game is quite simple: to begin with, you are given two random celebrities' brief description. The game is about guessing who has more followers on Instagram. The game is presented in two modalities. In the first modality, you are winning if and only if you run out of celebrity accounts to make a guess on.

<p>
  Higher Lower App is written in Python and you can launch it either from any local IDE which is able to compile Python source code, or any other Python code editors/compilers from the web which enables you to edit and run the code.
